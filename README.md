Python Guessing Game
Let's play the game

People love playing games and I decided to create a guessing game using python. The game asks a user to guess a lucky number between 0 to 100 and the user has 6 tries to get the number right or itâ€™s game over.
The games do check whether a user enters an integer or a string, if the user enters a string instead an integer; the user is then asked to enter a value option.

Installation

If you are planning to use this Python program as a script in your command interface, make sure you have Pyhton3 install in your system and run the file as a script. Also, you can run this Python program with your favorite Python-supported IDE.

Run the number_guessing.py file for the game. The demo.py file is just there for experimental purpose.
